            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>The Green Future Initiative was born out of a simple yet powerful idea: a sustainable world is possible if we all take action today. Our journey began with a small group of passionate environmentalists who saw the need for urgent change. What started as a local effort has now grown into a global movement dedicated to protecting nature, advocating for eco-friendly lifestyles, and inspiring positive environmental impact.</p>
